# ZNCBox
A Custom in-house developed IRC Bouncer (based off of ZNC)

---------------------------------
COMING SOON
---------------------------------

ZBOX (ZncBox) is currently a in-house developed service and IRC Bouncer. ZBox is currently in development, and a on-going process. As of right now we have not released the source publicly or allowed the source to be public until we complete it, and get out of the BETA stages. (~We are very close~).

ZBox is a IRC bouncer (software) and currently a SERVICE provided. During the development side of this project we have decided to offer it as a free service (with a PREMIUM package also); to provide anyone who wishes to try it out, BETA test it, help with development, add input (negative or positive feedback), make suggestions and so on.

As of right now we have been sponsored by 1 provider who has given us 3 different cloud accounts that has given us resources to spin up server(s) to run the Zbox service on, and we currently have 4 ZBox Nodes running in 2 different locations (US and EU); with each server having at minimal 25+ vHost/Bindhosts available (shared) amoung all the users to choose from, Unlimited Slots for Networks (you can use it for any network you wish), the service also has DDoS Mitigation of upto 200Gbps of protection per IPv4 address, we also have some custom filtering setup through a partner (AWKNET Communications) for additioanl DDoS Protection on our ZBox Nodes.

We have a fully custom setup (unlike ZNC and other IRC Bouncers) we provide tons of additional features that make us UNIQUE as of offering a web-chat client directly in the MEMBERS control panel; you can manage every detail of your account within the user control panel, from adding and removing networks, setting and configuring your accounts features and plugins (globally and user based).

Additionally, 

We are preparing ZncBox v1.0 and working hard to release it under a OpenSource type contract and allow other users to join in the development through GitHub. If you wish to find out more or follow along join us on irc at: irc.gonullyourself.com #zncbox (+6697 for SSL).
